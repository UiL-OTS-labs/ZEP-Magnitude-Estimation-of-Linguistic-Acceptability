Experiment:
        Magnitude Estimation of Linguistic Acceptability

Description:
        Purpose of this experiment is to measure the acceptability of a stimulus 
        (a sentence) a participant is perceiving relative to a standard stimulus
        (also known as the modulus). In every block, first, the modulus will be displayed. 
        For the modulus, the participant will enter a numerical value stating the acceptability 
        of the sentence. Then for each test trial the participant will be presented a sentence 
        to be judged. His task is to assign a score to the sentence relative to the score 
        entered for the modulus. 

        The sentences are displayed in a self-paced reading format, using a cumulative window 
        paradigm: the participant starts off with a single segment and he reveals next segment by hitting
        a button. The reaction times are stored, including one for a "special" word in the sentence, 
        a word that is most likely to cause a longer reading/reaction time. The resulting reaction times can 
        be used to cross-validate the magnitude estimations. 

        Note: the instructions and button texts are in Spanish.
